Project Title: Rookie Picker
Team Members: Shevin W, Larry Fuller, and Garrion Martin created an application that allows the user to view the betting odds on sports franchises (NFL) and select the team that they think will win the championship. The app will store the user's choice(team API) to later be selected from with a final team selection. The app is also educational by showing you a youtube video that's embedded to site that teaches the user the principles behind wagering/betting.
