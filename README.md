# Project2
Project Title: Rookie Picker
Team Members: Shevin W, Larry Fuller, and Garrion Martin created an application that allows the user to view the betting odds on sports franchises (NFL) and select the team that they think will win the championship. The app will store the user's choice(team API) to later be selected from with a final team selection. The app is also educational by showing you a youtube video that's embedded to site that teaches the user the principles behind wagering/betting. 

We developed our own API to store the NFL team selected by the user, which can be updated when the user makes a final selection of that team.

Larry Fuller: Javascript files integretion, testing and polished frontend.
Garrion Martin: Creation of mysql database,frontend, Schema and heroku deployment.
Shevin Weinstein: Handlebars,server connection, UI and compilation of securing accurate bedding odds.
